# First, run gsheet-yt_video_feed to pull the nodes, titles, authors, and youtube descriptions into a Gsheet 
# Then, upload your videos manually and place them into a playlist in program order manually
# Run yt_updater to update the video titles and descriptions of the videos in the playlist. This script will also push a column back into your spreadsheet with the video links of each video from the playlist. (WIP)
